## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Component

Here's a basic example of a Preact component using this boilerplate:

```jsx
import { h } from 'preact';
import { css } from 'goober';

const buttonStyle = css`
  background: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
`;

export function Button({ children }) {
  return <button class={buttonStyle}>{children}</button>;
}
```

### Responsive Image

Here's an example of how to use a responsive image within your Preact app:

```jsx
import { h } from 'preact';
import responsiveImage from './images/example.png';

export function ResponsiveImage() {
  return (
    <img
      src={responsiveImage.src}
      srcSet={responsiveImage.srcSet}
      sizes="(max-width: 600px) 300px, (max-width: 1200px) 600px, 1200px"
      alt="Example responsive image"
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, `responsiveImage` is an object generated by the responsive-loader, which includes:

- `src`: The default image source
- `srcSet`: A string containing all the generated image sizes and their URLs
- `width` and `height`: Dimensions of the original image
- `placeholder`: A base64-encoded placeholder image (if enabled in the config)

The `sizes` attribute tells the browser which image size to use at different viewport widths. Adjust these values based on your design needs.

To use this component:

```jsx
import { h } from 'preact';
import { ResponsiveImage } from './ResponsiveImage';

export function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <ResponsiveImage />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This setup allows you to easily use responsive images in your Preact app, optimizing performance by serving appropriately sized images for different devices and screen sizes.
